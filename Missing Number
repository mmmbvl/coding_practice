The following was a question that I received during a technical interview for an entry level software developer position. I thought I'd post it here so that everyone could give it a go:

You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?

function missingNo(nums) {
  let sum = nums.reduce((s, x) => s + x, 0) //Time :  O(n) -- reduce iterates through the array once
                                            //Space:  O(1) -- single variable independent of input
  return ((100 + 1) * 50) - sum
}
